# Joplin Ocean High Contrast Theme
My personal VSCode [Community Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=equinusocio.vsc-community-material-theme)'s Ocean High Contrast for Joplin. It's not 100% identical but quite similar. Mostly background colors are changed and everything else is Joplin's default UI and your system default font.

This theme is a modified version of [Joplin Light Theme](https://github.com/LongBay/Joplin-Light-Theme) by [LongBay](https://github.com/LongBay) originally [Joplin Clear UI theme](https://github.com/marcteys/joplin-theme-clearUI) by [Marc Teyssier](https://github.com/marcteys).
 
# How to Install
Enable one of the dark themes in joplin and copy userchrome.css and usersyle.css to your joplin config folder. in Linux ~/.config/joplin-desktop
